process vs threads 
- process are isolated from each other. but in threads data can be shared.
- bootup and hibernate are expensive in process, cheap on threads

- we cannot termiante worker from it's own code. it should be terminated from the master

- depends on where JS is running, can be considered as single thread ot multi threads.    
. the only thing we can only say about JS multi threads are: 
    . we don't have shared variables
    . as threre is event qeue, if two response comes at the exact time, then master can't send both of them to the workers
