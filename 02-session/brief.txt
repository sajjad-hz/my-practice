- in the beggining of bash files, there is start line called binBash (#!bin/bash)

- to give the permission to our file, to be run like a bash, use "chmod +x"

- how to figure out where is my bin file location? we can use "which [whatwewant]"

- base64: (64= 2^6)
. ASCII:
. decimal:
. binary:

- incremental ID:
. advantages: fast
. disadvantages: predictable, limited

- Buffer: 
. allocUnsafe doesn't reset the allocated buffer. allocUnsafe speed is > alloc speed
. in Buffer.from() we don't specify the amount of allocated bits. it's allcoated base on what we make Buffer.from()
. in JS string is immutable but we can immutate it by reassigning buffer 
. Buffer.set()
* if Buffer is 100% in use, what would happen in we want to allocate?

- Stream:


- web server: is an application that listens on specific ports and domains, and can respond to requests.    
. different webservers: nginx, appachi,...

- http.createServer((req,res){} returns 2 params: request and respnse
.res: res.write() accepts strings, number, buffer, base64...
. we can add other methods to the req  and res

- unlike othe programing languages (php,..) that cannot return when the respond is done, JS can do that

- GET vs POST request:
. GET: 1.faster 2.sends the query in the URL
. POST: 1. send data in the body. more secure. body is sent to the network as chunks.
